      <h1>Purpose</h1>
      <p>The purpose of the literary arts magazine (Fragments of Heaven) is to share the creative works of individuals with other creative people in order to spark idea, and also to showcase beautiful works to the general public. We aspire to promote creativity among individuals and to help dissipate artist/creator/ shyness and boost confidence among individuals. We also want to help individual artist/creators become more well-known, either in their local communities or online, and become a resource to help them perfect their craft, build their portfolios, and help to build their fan-base. We also want to be a consistent literary arts magazine that is open to the general public.
